Abstract:
We examine two aspects of media coverage of the economy. First, we look at what objective economic indicators drive the content of media coverage of the economy. Second, we look at the impact of media coverage of the economy on economic perceptions. We pay special attention to whether media coverage is driven by changes in mean family income and other aggregate measures, or changes in more dissaggregate measures such as the change in mean income of the bottom or top income quintile. And we compare the impact of objective economic indicators on media coverage across media sources: the New York Times, the Washington Poast, the Wall Street Journal, and USA Today.
We examine the impact of this media coverage of the economy on economic perceptions using the index of Consumer Sentiment, as well as other available survey data. We examine in particular whether the effect of media coverage on economic perceptions varies by: the income level of the individual; and the nature of the media outlet. Our analysis covers media coverage and public perceptions of the economy in the United States over a fifty year period.
